## The Nite Protocol's Mission and Philosophy

TODO

## The TRVL Token

**TRVL** is the utility token of the Nite Protocol. To know more about it, read [github.com/NiteProtocol/Info/TRVL.md](https://github.com/NiteProtocol/Info/TRVL.md).


## Repos

The Nite Protocol's core code is organized in the following repositories:

* [Property](https://github.com/NiteProtocol/Property) - Smart contracts that handle bookings in properties, as well as factories that deploy such property contracts.
* [PropertyFactory-Frontend](https://github.com/NiteProtocol/PropertyFactory-Frontend) - A frontend for interacting with instances of the factory contract, to easily deploy property contracts.
* [Property-Frontend](https://github.com/NiteProtocol/Property-Frontend) - A frontend for property managers to configure their property contracts.
* **BookingSiteTemplate-...** - Various booking site templates that property managers can use to create direct booking sites for their properties.
* [Explorer-Frontend](https://github.com/NiteProtocol/Explorer-Frontend) - A frontend where travelers can explore, discover and stake on properties.

The Nite Protocol also has the following auxiliary repos:

* [Pledge](https://github.com/NiteProtocol/Pledge) - Smart contracts to lock TRVL for a period of time and with a withdrawal delay upon unlocking.
* [Pledge-Frontend](https://github.com/NiteProtocol/Pledge-Frontend) - Frontend for pledging TRVL.
* [Brand](https://github.com/NiteProtocol/Brand) - Brand assets and guidelines.

*Note:* Some of the repos mentioned above are still under active development. Please check each repo's README to grasp its maturity level.

## Licenses

The Nite Protocol's code uses two licenses:

* [GPL v3](https://github.com/NiteProtocol/Licenses/GPL)
   * GPL v3 is a free software license that allows users to modify, distribute, and use software, with the condition that any derivative works also be licensed under the GPL v3 and that the source code is made available.
   * This license applies to all frontends as well as to smart contracts that do not relate to TRVL utility.
* [Token Utility License](https://github.com/NiteProtocol/Licenses/TUL)
   * TUL is a variation of GPL v3 with the additional condition that TRVL utility must be preserved and cannot be removed from the code.
   * This license applies to all smart contracts that provide utility to TRVL.

Each repo contains a `LICENSE` file, unambiguously specifying which license applies to its code.
